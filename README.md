# WordPress-Evergreen-Posts
Mark and keep track of your evergreen or most viral posts!

There are just some articles you write that did so well that you know you'll use them again. Sometimes, you write so much content, though, that things can get lost in the shuffle. Does this sound like you? Then welcome to Evergreen Posts.

With Evergreen Post you can make your most important articles and they will appear to you in two ways. First, on All Posts as a column with a green indicator. Secondly, it has its own dedicated page to show you what posts you marked. From there, you can copy or republish or whatever you need to do.
